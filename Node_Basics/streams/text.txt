What are Streams?

In Node.js, streams are collections of data, which might not be available in full at once and don't have to fit in memory.

Think of them as conveyor belts that move data from one place to another, allowing you to work with each piece as it arrives rather than waiting for the whole dataset.

Streams are one of Node.js's most powerful features and are used extensively in:

    File system operations (reading/writing files)
    HTTP requests and responses
    Data compression and decompression
    Database operations
    Real-time data processing

There are several advantages to using streams:

    Memory Efficiency: Process large files without loading them entirely into memory
    Time Efficiency: Start processing data as soon as you have it, instead of waiting for all the data
    Composability: Build powerful data pipelines by connecting streams
    Better User Experience: Deliver data to users as it becomes available (e.g., video streaming)

Imagine reading a 1GB file on a server with 512MB of RAM:

    Without streams: You'd crash the process attempting to load the entire file into memory
    With streams: You process the file in small chunks (e.g., 64KB at a time)
